# Arena Scheduling

## The Project
This is a PHP web application which allows students to perform Arena Scheduling for their desired classes. This was my
senior project for Chartiers Valley High School in 2013. While not meant for a full scale organization scheduling, it was
used for 7+ years for "Career Day" and other events requiring scheduling of multiple sessions.

At the time, we should select our desired classes on paper which would then be hand entered into the school's scheduling
application for our main courses. For non-academic classes, they would gather a huge pile of papers and hand schedule them
into sessions. I wanted to help alleviate the need for manual scheduling and allow my hardworking teachers to use their
time doing something else.

I want to thank my 8th grade english teacher, Mrs. Schultz, who encouraged and supported me every step of the way with 
this project. I was teaching myself PHP (lol why), and she gave me the platform, safety, and courage to build this out.

## Disclaimers
This is overall a very, very poorly coded application. I taught myself PHP in the 6th grade and this was my first "full-scale"
application using the language.

**Reasons why I would not use the app as is**:
- It's PHP kekw.
- It's poorly coded for all I know, but it works well.
- Security is done via session, it's not terrible, but it's not safe.
- You're going to find hard coded credentials in the code. I don't care, those databases have not run in 10 years. Now being
a professional I know how to securely separate credentials from code, but this app is a product of its time.
- It only supports 3 and only 3 sessions.

**Reasons why I put it up despite the aforementioned**:
- I'm really proud of it as my first real project as a kid.
- I'm sharing it as a time capsule back to more ignorant times of quality control and security practices.
- I got an A+ on my senior project so who's laughing now?

**Please** skip right over this if you're a future employer of mine. I wrote this in the 8th grade.
